 Excited to Share My Second Internship Project! ✨💻

 I’m thrilled to announce the completion of my second project as part of my web development internship journey at #InternOrbit! 🚀



💻 Project Overview:

 I developed a responsive To-Do App using React.js, packed with essential features to enhance productivity and demonstrate real-world CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations—a vital concept for most applications.



⚙️ Key Features & Technologies:

 ✅ Create, edit, and delete tasks

 ✅ Persistent data with localStorage 🗂️

 ✅ Responsive design for both desktop and smartphone 📱💻

 ✅ Engaging notifications using React Toast library 🔔

 ✅ Leveraged React Hooks like useState and useEffect for smooth state management



🎯 Learning Outcomes:

 🔑 Enhanced understanding of state management with hooks

 🔑 Improved dynamic component rendering

 🔑 Strengthened concepts of storing and retrieving data from the browser’s local storage
